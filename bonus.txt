1)sometimes requesting data for the keyword takes a long time (> 5 seconds), what can be done to
make it faster? What are downsides of your solution?

Use small page size to fetch results
exclude extra columns

Downside::
Used too much manual nodes of array


2) weâ€™d like to add as many product feeds as possible, how would you structure a service with this
requirement?

I would prefer to go for laravel framework and follow the standards and best practices give
